# Welcome to Stealthness's Github

I am a part-time demonstrator for the Faculty of Science at Birkbeck, University of London and a solo independent games developer. 

## Games Development

# Stealthness Games at itch.io

I am primarily developing games with Unity with Rider, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Piskel for character design and animation. I also use Audacity to edit sounds, which I mostly find on Pixabay. 

I am self-taught in game design using free online tutorials, resources from [O'riells](https://learning.oreilly.com/), and applying these skills learnt in game jams like Trijam, which is hosted on Itch.io.

Below are some examples;

## ðŸ”­ Birkbeck

I'm also a teaching demonstrator at Birkbeck, teaching Python and Java to undergraduates and graduate students. Previously, I was researching a PhD/MPhil at Birkbeck University [[link](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/)]. My research investigates the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to find a sub-optimal feature selection, combined with a Federated Learning (FL) process to find a suitable classifier for Image Classification (IC) problems in an environment where resources are limited.

## Miscellaneous

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been slowly improving my health, primarily through running. I can be found at parkrun most weekends and have completed many other distances, including one marathon.

âš¡ Fun fact: I suffer from Dyslexia, but I do not let that stop me. It means that my written work can have mistakes, so it can be hard to read my stuff at times.

# Updates

## September 2024

So, I took a break from game development to focus on improving my health over the summer. I was due to start a new course, but the funding did not materialise. So now I am back on game development.

## January 2024

New Year has started, and one goal this year is to produce and publish a game on Steam.

## August 2023

I have cleared out old repositories. I have archived two, deleted abandoned projects, and created several private repositories that I want to keep for self-referencing but are too old to maintain.
