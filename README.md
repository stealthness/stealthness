# Welcome to Stealthness's Github

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning games development using Unity games engine and Blender for 3D modelling. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a part time demonstrator for Birkbeck, teaching Python and Java to undergraduates and gradutes students. Previously I was a researching a PhD/MPhil Birckbeck University [[link](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/)]. My research was investigating genetic programming for image classification.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been running to improve my health since 2017, including regually attending races and parkruns. In October 4th 2022 I will be running the London Marathon, having had to defer twice becuase of the covid pandemic.
