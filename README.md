# Welcome to Stealthness's Github

Hi, my name is Stephen West.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning game development using the Unity games engine. You can find some of the games I have developed whilst learning at Itch.io

## Recent Game made for Trijam

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also a teaching demonstrator at Birkbeck, teaching Python and Java to undergraduates and graduate students. Previously I was researching a PhD/MPhil at Birkbeck University [[link](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/)]. My research was investigating genetic programming for image classification.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been slowly improving my health, primarily through running. I can be found at parkrun most weekends and have completed many other distances, including one marathon.

âš¡ Fun fact: I suffer from Dyslexia, but I do not let that stop me, but it does mean that my written work can have mistakes, so it can be hard to read my stuff at times.
