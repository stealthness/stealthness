# Welcome to Stealthness's Github

Hi, my name is Stephen West.

I am a part-time demonstrator for the Faculty of Science at Birkbeck, University of London and a solo independent games developer. 

## Games Development

# Stealthness Games at itch.io

Primary developing games with Unity with Visual Studio with  Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Animator for character design and animation and Audacity for editing sounds. I use Piskelapp for pixel art and prototyping. 

I have self-learned game design in the last two years, applying tools like Unity to publish various small games on the Itch.io platform. I have participated in game jams, including Trijam and Brackey's game jam, and gained valuable feedback from each.

## ðŸ”­ Birkbeck

I'm also a teaching demonstrator at Birkbeck, teaching Python and Java to undergraduates and graduate students. Previously I was researching a PhD/MPhil at Birkbeck University [[link](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/)]. My research investigates the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to find a sub-optimal feature selection, combined with a Federated Learning (FL) process to find a suitable classifier for Image Classification (IC) problems in an environment where resources are limited.

## Miscellaneous

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been slowly improving my health, primarily through running. I can be found at parkrun most weekends and have completed many other distances, including one marathon.

âš¡ Fun fact: I suffer from Dyslexia, but I do not let that stop me, but it does mean that my written work can have mistakes, so it can be hard to read my stuff at times.

# Updates

## August 2023

There has been a clear-out of old repositories. I have archived two, deleted abandoned projects and made several repositories private that I want to keep for self-referencing but are too old to maintain.
